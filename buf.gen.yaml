    # NOTE: For the Deno LSP to pick up the TS files properly, we had to
    # generate them within the Deno project, otherwise it would bork on the type
    # inference. Since at the moment we're just generating the types for this
    # project and this solution fixed it, it wasn't worth spending more time on
    # troubleshooting any longer.
